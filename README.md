## Project Goals

The goal of this project is not necessarily accuracy. I value accuracy in so far as it allows us to harness the uncanniness of familiarity.

For example, I do not intend to implement a Liquid-Glass-ified version of the UI (though if someone does want to take that on and create multiple UI "skins" I would welcome that.)

## Features I'd Like To Implement

- [ ] Support for photos
- [ ] Saving/loading "drafts" in local storage

## Development

I've set up some formatting and tests. To run them:

```bash
npm install

npm test

# write formatting changes
npm run format

# check formatting (CI-style)
npm run format:check
```
